# Julius Rou travel

### Web-GIS of YouTube travel videos filming locations developed with Quasar Framework and MapLibre GL JS

“Julius travelings” – is a web-GIS app, which was mainly developed to show dynamically the locations where YouTube videos were filmed. It is important to know for audience because as usual JuliusRou films several videos about different districts of the same city. And of course a map – is much better way of data visualization than traditional playlist in YouTube.
